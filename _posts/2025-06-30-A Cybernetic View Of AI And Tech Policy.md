I recently contributed a pair of literature reviews to a research group clustered around lethal autonomous weapons as well as data tools designed to identify, track and designate targets for killing. This is no longer dystopian science fiction - these tools are in use today, employed by a genocidal, nuclear superpower against the people of Gaza, Palestine. 

From this context, we investigated policy approaches towards the use of these weapons from a number of Western nations, and we naturally identified that a race between two powers to develop LAWs would be irreversible and devastating, similar conclusions reached by multiple S-risk thinktanks throughout the world. 

Despite the relative success of nuclear-non-proliferation treaties, by all accounts a policy success, we were working against a backdrop of Israeli aggression against Iran based on claims that they were just days away from producing a nuclear weapon. Claims that have been repeated since the 90's, and that Tulsi Gabbard herself went on record as denying. This cast a pall of hopelessness on our efforts to analyse policy as an effective tool for preventing catastrophe. The catastrophe was happening, and it would happen again. If not with nukes, then with swarms of self-healing semi-autonomous drones. 

The combined Israeli-US aggression in the Middle East has proven to all nations on Earth that not possessing a nuclear deterrent means your sovereignty is in question, and therefore your ability to defend your right to exist. Treaties are directional. 

What we have observed in Gaza is a state of almost total surveillance of the citizens by the Israeli military, tracking their movements via their cell phones, assigning them 'suspicion' scores via inference and positive unlabelled machine learning, using regression models to identify civilian structures the destruction of which would yield the maximum psychological impact. War crimes. 

The existential issues that haunt us as a species seem to be inoperable across borders. There is an inability to address industrial emissions, ice cap failure, biodiversity collapse and arms races. Rather than become mired in defeat, we must accept the challenges faced by our current models, and ask the question of why.

For this, I'm turning to English anthropologist Gregory Bateson's work on exploding the processes that lead to marked success in another area thought to be inoperable: alcoholism.

At the time he wrote 'The Cybernetics Of Self', Alcoholic's Anonymous had the only outstanding record of helping alcoholics into recovery and back to sobriety. Bateson used his study of AA premises to draw several conclusions about the Occidental theory of mind. He begins by identifying a distinct lack of language to explain the combination of epistemology and ontology that circumscribes notions of the Self, which he also refers to as 'a body of habitual assumptions or premises implicit in the relationship between man and environment.' Ontology and epistemology cannot be separated. Man's beliefs about the world will determine how he sees and acts within it, and his ways of perceiving and acting will determine his beliefs about its nature. Bateson states that any ongoing ensemble of events and objects which has the appropriate complexity of causal circuits and energy relations will show mental characteristics, and asserts that mind is not immanent nor transcendental, but an emanation of a network of sensors. Bateson's proposal, which is a new epistemology rooted in cybernetics and systems theory, can, in my view, provide us with a breakthrough - both in terms of how we understand arms races, and how we design agile policy to cope with emergent technological objects.

Bateson gives an example of a train conductor: A train conductor is hardly a conductor at all - it does not have unilateral control of the system. Essentially, the conductor is a sense organ or transducer, receiving a transform of the difference between the actual running speed of the engine and some ideal or preferred speed. This sense organ transforms these differences into some efferent message, to fuel supply or to brake. **The behaviour of this conductor is determined, in other words, by the behaviour of the other parts of the system and indirectly by its own behaviour at a previous time.**

We know that no part of an internally interactive system can have unilateral control over the remainder or over any other part. In the case of alcoholism, the 'will' of the alcoholic can therefore never triumph entirely over the bottle, and in the case of governmental policy - it cannot unilaterally control a circuit that includes militaries, economies, national myth, research labs, engineering departments, natural element processing plants of multiple nations who are themselves networked together in increasingly complex ways. 

Bateson gives us another, plainer example: that of a woodcutter. He says that the Occidental tends to view actions as a linear series of delimited means acting upon delimited ends. He says 'The woodcutter cuts down the tree.' A cybernetic view of the event would portray it as a circular diagram proceeding from brain  $\rightarrow$  muscles  $\rightarrow$   axe  $\rightarrow$   stroke  $\rightarrow$   tree  $\rightarrow$   eyes   $\rightarrow$  brain. It is inaccurate to say that any one part of this network is responsible for felling the tree: rather each station in the circuit transforms an amount of information. Information is a difference that makes a difference. And for that information to bear meaning or action, it must pass around the total circuit. 

This places policy logically within a chain of entities from which emanates the technological eventualities that are the subject of policy. Seen this way, policy does not need to halt progress, or ban production - which is impossible to do. It merely has to become integrated into the flow and transmit its transforms of information effectively - its philosophical, cognitive, empirical work. 

Next, Bateson gives us a usual abstraction - all relationships, of any kind, can be characterised in one of two ways - symmetrical or complementary. If an increase in any given behaviour in A stimulates an increase of behaviour in B - the relationship is symmetrical. 

The struggle of the alcoholic's personal willpower against the call of the bottle is a symmetrical relationship - the more the alcoholic tries to resist, the stronger the bottle seems to be, requiring greater and greater willpower to be resisted. Bateson also uses arms races as an example of symmetrical relationships. He then theorizes that the step the alcoholic makes from sobriety into intoxication is a step from a symmetrical relationship into one of complementarity. Escalation within symmetrical struggle is due to undamped or uncorrected positive feedback in the system. If this is the ultimate goal of policy, then the way in which it intervenes can focus keenly on this dampening or correcting effect. Perhaps, advocate for governmental price-setting of access to natural minerals, or the imposing of internal tariffs? Bitter pills to swallow for any government, but there is a rich area in which work can be done. 

I believe that the cybernetic view of governance and policy makes it plain to see where policy sits, and frees it up from its obligation to be the only defence we have against technological collapse. It is most effective when it is simultaneous to innovation and production, and does not cease to be effective once it is disobeyed.
