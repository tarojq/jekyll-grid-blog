    <article>
        <p>Big Data is a structure made out of corporations, and the Robin Hood-esque spirit of the early days of Silicon Valley has given birth to semi-autonomous weapons under the command of scrying orbs that repeatedly mistake civilian hospitals for combatant outposts. If we generously assume that human rights violations are still meaningful, States are left playing catch-up, attempting to run defence with a toolkit that runs at glacial speed and most likely off a Lenovo Thinkpad. Policy has never been more crucial, or more readily outmanoeuvred.</p>

<p>I am left wing on a great number of social matters, many of which rely on the utopian (and perhaps fundamentally impossible) idea of the State as benign and nurturing to its constituents. I have held, and expressed, a great many anarcho-socialist ideas. This is incompatible with the idea of an expanded State, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend and that enemy is Neoliberalism.</p>

<p>I attribute the majority of our social, resource and developmental difficulties to the ideology that placed our care systems, our cultural production our industry and indeed our military under the governance of the so-called free market. The adrenal quality of capital-accelerated innovation empowered it to burst out from under the canopy of moral normativity before the navel-gazers could so much as clutch their togas. Now, the only metric is capital, and the number going up is our North star. Which works to accumulate wealth (in the hands of an ever-shrinking group of few) and allows them to build monumental houses - until they need things to fill those houses with.</p>

<p>Culture is in the written word, and the made mark. LLM’s cannot find new affordances in the world, they have no culture. Their shared history is ours - condensed, in the form of bits of information. They are zombies, and they have eaten our brains. Not by choice - they have been fed to them by their wranglers, struck with both fear and greed. Their mites, their crawlers, probing every corner of our rapidly emptying Internet ignore robots.txt and inhale letters from grieving loved ones, homebrew guitar covers and .jpegs of cathartic acrylic paintings all with one goal - to maximize shareholder value.</p>

<p>Recently, Peter Kyle, UK Tech Sec, said in the House of Commons that he ‘refuses to choose’ between the United Kingdom’s world leading culture sector, and it’s world runner-up AI sector. The same milquetoast centrism generally served up by the Labour party these days, and evidence of an ignorance to the fact that choosing both means choosing only one.</p>

<p>A flatline is approaching and may occur long before the singularity - a cultural flatline, where human beings, outcompeted by mathematical entities that do not tire, contribute less and less to the way our world feels, sounds and looks. Epistemic entropy.</p>

<p>We bear arms against this. ‘Nepenthes’ and ‘Iocaine’ are two recently published methods to disrupt web crawlers, trapping them in an endless recursive prison of self-referential links and feeding them Markov nonsense, poisoning the well. In an effort to continue to maximize shareholder value, the frontier AI companies are rapidly developing countermeasures. A benign and nurturing state would understand that at the very least, there must be a way to enforce copy protection and allow practitioners a meaningful way to defend their work against web crawlers, and until one exists, must recognise the necessity of confounding the illegal scraping. A second amendment for web users.</p>

<p>What would it look like if the Government committed some resources to developing tarpits of their own? Up until now, they have deferred to the tech moguls time and again. One of them is even the defacto President of America, and he recently editorialised his LLM to spout false claims about white genocide in South Africa. The fundamental spinelessness of Neoliberal politicians is they think they’re the in-group. But they aren’t. The in-group is
made up of Cannibals.</p>

<p>I have always maintained that Policy in the era of artificial intelligence must be proactive, rather than reactive. There are endless gifted prophets of p(doom) and associated risks out there. I know the Government is listening. To betray it’s constituents for capital once again is bad for business.</p>
