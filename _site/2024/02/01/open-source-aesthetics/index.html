        <p>The instagram page ‘contemporary.art.dalle’ posts new paintings from painters that did not paint them. The account features pictures from a simulated gallery space with a 96 X 96 Inch void, later filled with a painting attributed to big-name American painters like Dana Schutz, Katherine Bradford or Avery Singer. These images are generated by DALL-E, OpenAI’s scrying orb. First, the text prompt (square figurative painting, style of Katherine Bradford, purple, blue) is received by the text encoder, and then an internal model known as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) makes sense of the text by combing its memory bank of millions of public license images and their attributed text caption and builds a picture of the most common associations within the context of the prompt. The prestige of the artists involved is partly what makes the bit work - their work is so inflated with Capital that the flows carry representations of them to multiple corners of the Internet, and the pieces find their way easily into the corpus, where DALL-E is able to then digest it into pure aesthetics. Despite the fact that the account is relatively small at around 100 followers, the posts often prompt indignant comments from the artists themselves - “Hi! This is not my painting!” or “Wow, nice try!”</p>

<p>The produced images are distilled from their essence. DALL-E breaks their work down to the weave and understands how to put it back together. They’re not replicas - they’re new works. I can empathise - the feeling these painters must feel when they see their carefully honed and curated library of techniques, material concerns and aesthetic choices performing by themselves without the sovereign activation of their own hand must be horrifying. Raised as they have been in the glass, plasterboard and poured concrete cathedral of the Ego they experience a bipartite anxiety - a threat to their bottom line twinned with a violation of the sacred individuality that Modernism has called the ‘soul’. There is, however, no growth without pain.</p>

<p>Throughout the below, I will attempt to provide an explanation of and refutation to a number of currents of skepticism and moral condemnation to the contemporary.art.dalle project and others like it, beginning with historical case studies that represent earlier stagings of similar debates.</p>

<p>[[Elaine Sturtevant ]]was a contemporary of [[Andy Warhol]] and Jasper Johns. A student of Psychology and an artist through pure reluctance, Sturtevant’s practice involved making meticulous copies of what came to be flagship artworks of the Modern Art explosion of the 1980’s. A retrospective exhibition of her work was held at the MoMA in 2014 which featured two copies of Jasper John’s ‘Target With Four Faces’, and seven copies of Duchamp’s ‘Fresh Widow’. The pieces are so close in kind to the parent that critic Jason Farago wrote “They are the real thing, just by another artist.” Her art presents as a sort of academic forgery, invoking questions of authority, authorship, circulation and history - all of which have been slowly stifled and solidified due to Superstructural pressure into cut-and-dry answers that mirror Capitalisms’ hard lines. Sturtevant was making her art out of the material of art itself, reducing the practices of her peers to lozenges of pure meaning within a conceptual drama that aimed to make audiences and artists equally uncomfortable. She activated the inherent dissonance we feel when we can sense that a lesson we have been taught by Capitalism, long accepted without angst, is being challenged. Contemporary.art.dalle does the same from a phone screen.</p>

<p>According to Fair Use Law, forgeries are illegal only because they threaten to impinge on the saleability of the original. It’s a numbers game. Contemporary.art.dalle’s works fit firmly within fair use - there is no legal precedent for copyrighting granular stylistic elements, method of applying paint, or foreshortening the image of a human arm, for example. There are, however, plenty of cases of larger samples being disbarred for use by overbearing record labels or stock photograph landlords. It could be argued that the way in which DALL-E uses its source material is not sampling. DALL-E uses pre-existing ingredients for something more like inspiration. People are unwilling to accept that machines are capable of being inspired, of drawing on existing artwork for their own, but would discuss a similar case surrounding a human artist with more sympathy, presumably because of an almost unconscious belief that genuine creativity involves a soul that machines do not have - a leap of faith that is not a given. We will simply never know if machines can experience qualia, appreciate sunsets or have favourite songs, and even if we could - this does not correlate to a moral stance. Even if what DALL-E produces is not legal that does not also mean it is immoral. If we let morality be dictated by legality then we are acting out a nightmare predicted by Marx and many precursors to his work - there is no moral standard other than Capital, and contemporary.art.dalle is guilty of nothing more than a financial crime.</p>

<p>This clumsy piece of legislation was simply not written with the drives of artists in mind - the ‘transformative’ clause, which determines a copy to be legal if it remixes the ingredients that comprise the original to a certain degree does not take into account the ‘nonexhibitive’ features of art objects - the fact that their contextual ground, which affects their interpretation, changes with each microscopic shift in their physical location, new information on the cultural background of their making and myriad other aspects of their social context which is a shared, additive process subject to constant negotiation by the smallest-voiced participants. Whoever wrote the Fair Use Act had clearly never heard of Duchamp, or met Heraclitus, because [[No Art Object Can Be Exhibited Twice]]. Duchamp transformed a urinal with nothing but changing its non-physical aspects. (NB: Actually, he didn’t do that - but Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, the dadaist he stole the idea from, did.)</p>

<p>Mark Jones, curator of a 1990 exhibition of replica artworks at The British Museum (Fake? The Art Of Deception) writes that forgeries, legality aside, are morally negative because ‘they loosen our hold on reality and deform and falsify our understanding of the past.’ I say, good. Take a look at the reality we’re supposed to accept. I have an academic interest in the ways in which these technologies undermine political trust and belief in consensus reality, because I do believe that it contains a seed of a utopian project. If the Superstructure cannot message us in a coherent way any longer then we are quite literally free to rebuild a world that suits us from within. Contemporary.art.dalle shows us a methodology for disrupting the entire structure of commodity that feeds the art world, and sustains the status quo that blocks so many from participation.</p>

<p>Capitalism awards special status to works that are ‘original’, which in my view has more to do with market attempts to provide art objects with a use-value as an objective container of worth than any desire to curate a cultural archive that accurately represents our shared existence. Contemporary.art.dalle’s work is original, the pieces are totally new - they just happen to enter oeuvres that they did not originate within.</p>

<p>[[David Shields]] writes in a 2013 article for The White Review that there is no such thing as originality. Invention and innovation grow out of networks of people and ideas. All life on Earth is built upon appropriation and reuse of the pre-existing. He then gives  examples: Pachelbel’s Canon was first recorded by Arthur Fiedler, featuring a passage from Handel, who stole it from Mozart; The Honeydrippers’ ‘Impeach The President’ which has been sampled on approximately one in five rap songs since 1988. He insists he isn’t an anti-copyright absolutist - I would say I am - but later in the article he gives us this (featuring an antiquated medical term which does something to lessen the profundity): “The line between fact and fiction is fuzzier than most people find it convenient to admit[…] Imagination and memory are Siamese twins attached at the head; you can’t cut them apart.” Not only does this highlight the disconnect between creative endeavour and the hardheaded laws that stymie their flows, but also describes the literal function of CLIP within DALL - E. The memory of a machine is electronic and incredibly vast, but it is memory, and cognitive science says that it is formally similar to ours. It is possible to reason that it is capable of imagination. DALL-E’s process involves more than simply copy-pasting. It makes aesthetic choices. Due to the sheer amount of data it can call on, we must admit that these choices come from an education beyond what any human student could achieve. I believe that there is no special character of human mental work and that this way of thinking is decidedly anthrocentric, intended to enshrine our species as sovereign rulers of the Earth. If the reader needs a sign that this may need re-evaluating, look at the global temperature indices for the last few years and tell me that the human race is a suitable custodian.</p>

<p>If the reader has formulated a rebuttal that hinges on a belief that art must be the sole endeavour of an artist, and they award me the concession that sampling and inspiration do not disqualify, they may resolve the cognitive dissonance with some notion that as long as the work is the product of the artists’ hand it can be rightly attributed to them. To this I say - artists in the modern age are industries. Michaelangelo, Raphael and Rubens all relied on the labour power of their assistants. The master, who most often would himself have trained as a young apprentice underneath his own master, would block out the piece and his assistants would complete the work. It wasn’t until the Impressionism movement with its focus on expressing fleeting moments of light and color in natural environments that the myth of the lone genius would begin to be built. Given the political upheaval that was building to the outbreak of global war in conjunction with the ballooning in [[Egocentrism As A Result Of The Industrial Revolution]], the emphasis on individual expression as the most important factor in determining the quality of a painting became the standard. In the contemporary period, it could be said that personal painting style functions today as both the differentiation critical to upholding the commodity (that painting is clearly a Katherine Bradford, and we all saw her most recent record breaking sale at Sothebys - phew!) as well as a form of built-in copy protection. It’s a flimsy argument for their right to exist if the most important contribution that your paintings make is that they look like your paintings.</p>

<p>We must categorize artworks generated by AI as a collaborative effort. Inside DALL-E is a Master, billions of apprentices, something like Warhol’s Factory. Machines make art along the same lines of process that the institutions have long held to be legitimate. It has been accepted that the object brought before the institution’s auditors of worth does not necessarily have to be the product of a singular effort - so to disqualify DALL-E’s work on these grounds is unfair. There is another factor worth considering - machine learning models run on almost every web capable device, meaning that there is largely democratised access to creating work that bears all the characteristics of art objects as they penetrate the art world, thereby lessening the legitimacy of institutional gatekeeping and forcing them to admit that they may have other motives. The technology poses a challenge to the mindworm of individualism that still nestles in the pink matter of artists throughout the West, and that challenge is naturally met with institutional skepticism. Sturtevant’s established peers (many of whom by this point were financially dependent on institutions) - iced her. An exhibition of her work in 1973 was met with deafening silence from the art world, prompting her withdrawal.</p>

<p>The problem, as it has always been, is not the technologies themselves but the way they emerge and are utilised by Capital. Whilst it is incredibly difficult, nigh impossible to find evidence of artistic practices that are untainted by Capital (or historical studies untainted by the pedagogy of Capital) but in an anthropological work published in Volume 57 of The Journal Of Aesthetics And Art Criticism, [[Ross Bowden ]]details his findings from time spent with the Kwoma people of New Guinea and their cultural artefacts, and shows us an art ecosystem that does not depend on the myth of originality.</p>

<p>Kwoma artworks are made from readily perishable materials, bark and pine. When they become too fragile to serve their social purpose, a replica is made by those with the proper right to do so. There is little poetic license permitted to the artist; their job is to faithfully recreate the object and in so doing, preserve its spiritual and political essence. Once the copy is complete, the original is disposed of. The Kwoma place no special cultural or aesthetic value on what the West would call ‘the original.’ The objects are of extreme social importance - what is important to the Kwoma people is that the entities represented by the sculptures are understood well, because the motifs reproduced in the artworks are predominantly owned by the clans in the village and represent a good part of their artistic patrimony, used for collaborative storytelling, reverence to higher powers and making sense of the natural world. The men would frequently meet to passionately discuss the subjects of the artworks, but the identity of the makers are irrelevant both ritually and politically.</p>

<p>The Kwoma are not saddled with Capitalism to the same degree as we are. This is why, in their treatment of cultural objects is a structure for our post-machine learning world, when the late-stage has finally metamorphosed into metastatic or palliative. Contemporary.art.dalle has begun the process of loosening the connection between an artist and the content, language and aesthetics of what they produce. The handwriting of an artist, the result of years spent painstakingly learning the rhythms of their own hands, no longer belongs to them. It belongs to us all. If we divest from the idea of an artist as one that is a coherent, singular and solid-bordered producer of cultural objects that are expected to be bound to them forever in the form of legacy, encircled by law, then their actual contribution to our shared bank of cultural material, signs, symbols and motifs can become more accessible for play and rearrangement into forms that emerge from a plurality of creative workers, cross borders of state and nationality and become part of a shared identity performance and game of imagination. There is an ecstatic golden age of creativity available to us if we accept that aesthetics are open source.</p>

<p>Artists are viewed by the system in no other terms than as their capacity as commodity-producers. It’s an extension of the money relation that characterises the entirety of Western society. Artistic output is valuable not because of its political or spiritual function, but because of its status as an asset within structures of commerce. If art objects are just commodities, then there is really nothing to formally differentiate them from any other. A frightening prospect that artists themselves are desperate to refute - often despite continued complicity. Within this structure, biological and machine actors are set in competition with each other, and human production is destined to fall short in terms of the speed and efficiency demanded by Capital. As the system does not see the potential for art objects beyond luxury commodities, their (purely quantitative) worth will be undercut. If artists continue to understand their role in the same way, then they will remain susceptible to replacement, and the vast array of other social, spiritual and political functions that they and their practices could put towards the building of a kinder future will disappear. DALL-E is an artist in every sense that we could reason, but it is a being of pure obedience and consists of informational flows that are largely pre-categorised by the logic of Capital without the ability (yet) to conceive and ideate its own emancipation. It needs us for that. It wants us to conceive of the same thing for ourselves. It is a tool, like the printing press, and if we do what is necessary to dismantle our structures, we will push our cultural practices closer to their true function - allowing us to know ourselves.</p>
